# 283. Move Zeroes

Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Example:

Input: [0,1,0,3,12]

Output: [1,3,12,0,0]

Note:

1. You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
2. Minimize the total number of operations.

Solution:


```python
def move_values_in_list_to_the_end(the_list, val):   
    count=0
    while val in l:
        count+=1
        the_list.remove(val)

    
    the_list.extend([val]*count)
```

Test:


```python
l = [0,1,0,3,12]
move_values_in_list_to_the_end(l, 0)
l
```




    [1, 3, 12, 0, 0]
